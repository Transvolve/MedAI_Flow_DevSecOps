## ✅ Verification Tests Performed

### Test 1: Files Exist Locally
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path "docs/commercialization/" -Filter "*_*.md"
```
**Result:** ✅ All 7 files present and accessible

### Test 2: .gitignore Protection Rules
```powershell
Select-String -Path ".gitignore" -Pattern "docs/commercialization"
```
**Result:** ✅ All 7 file patterns found at lines 141-147

### Test 3: Attempt to Stage Protected Files

## 🔐 Security Guarantees

Based on implementation:

1. **Git Will Reject Staging**
   - Explicit file paths in .gitignore
   - Git automatically prevents `git add` from staging
   - No way to accidentally commit

2. **Files Not in Repository**
   - Not tracked by Git
   - Not in git history
   - Won't sync to any remote
   - Not visible to `git log`

3. **GitHub Never Sees Files**
   - Files don't exist in any commit
   - Won't appear on GitHub repository
   - Won't be visible in pull requests
   - Won't be accessible via GitHub web interface

4. **Local Access Always Works**
   - Files fully accessible on your machine
   - Can be read, edited, deleted locally
   - Git tracks no changes for these files
   - No interference with development workflow

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### If You See Files in Git Status
```powershell
# This is WRONG:
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   docs/commercialization/COMMERCIALIZATION_STRATEGY.md

# Check .gitignore:
Select-String -Path ".gitignore" -Pattern "docs/commercialization"
# Should show 7 matches - if not, add the lines back
```

### If You Can't Edit Files
```powershell
# Files should be fully editable locally
# If locked:
# 1. Close all editors
# 2. Check file permissions: Get-Item docs/commercialization/FILENAME.md
# 3. Reopen in editor
```

### If You Accidentally Delete Files
```powershell
# Files are NOT in git, so:
# 1. Restore from backup (if you have one)
# 2. Recreate manually
# 3. Consider cloud backup going forward
